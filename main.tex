		Roorkee}{Roorkee}{}{\vspace{2pt} During the period of 2 months, I
		worked on research in the following domains:}} \begin{enumerate}
			 \item \textbf{Image Super-Resolution:}
				 Implemented a naive Multi Image Super Resolution model.
				 Developed a new Deep Model using a Deconvolutional Neural
				 Networks which was better than all of the state of art methods
				 for
				 this problem of reconstruction. This model was trained and tested on Ucmerced dataset. The results were much
				 better than existing models.
			\vspace{3pt}
			 \item \textbf{Joined autoencoder and classification:}
					 Conducted few experiments on joint classification with
					 autoencoded features on Hyper-Spectral Data rather than independent autoencoder and classifier.

\subsection{Selected Projects}

\vspace{4pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\textbf{Author of word-completion feature GNU-Nano text editor :}%\textit{'Development of an Intelligent Humanoid Robot'}

\vspace{3pt}

		\small{\begin{itemize}

			\item Added a feature to GNU-Nano that completes the word under the cursor when the shortcut  is pressed which
		on subsequent calls displays the next suggestions.
			\item Supports UTF-8.
		 	\item Accepted and released in GNU-Nano v2.7.3 by the maintainer.
			\end{itemize}
		}}

		\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{Optical Character Recognition(OCR) for Devanagri Scripts (Incomplete):}

\vspace{3pt}

		\small{
			\begin{itemize}
			\item I worked on the classification of characters of this project while others worked on segmentation.
			\item As of now, basic characters(only %ka khaक ख ग
				..) segmented by this process were tested using SVM with linear kernel
				(130 fonts). This was testing on similar fonts and the accuracy was found about to be around 95\%
			\item Looking forward to use CNN and passing the entire character as feature vector to the network.
			\end{itemize}
			}}	

		\vspace{6pt}

\item{\textbf{Mouse Control using Hand Gestures}

\vspace{3pt}

		\small{
			\begin{itemize}
					\item The image was binarized and contours were found out.
					\item The contour with largest area was considered.
					\item  Convex hull was found out and the angle between the
					finger-point and the palm point was calculated and if it
				was less than 90\degree{} fingers were detected.  \item The
					points of palm were tracked and its co-ordinates were
					mapped to cover the entire screen resolution.
					\item Number of fingers denoted what action is to be taken place viz movement, left click, right click.
			\end{itemize}
			}}
		\vspace{6pt}

	
\item{\textbf{Implementing a Shared Memory on two microcontrollers}

\vspace{3pt}

		\small{
			\begin{itemize}
					\item Implemented a shared memory model on SD Card using two ARM7 Controllers.
					\item The algorithm used was a variation of Dekker's algorithm using two hardware lines for handshaking.
					\item This resolved problem of deadlocks and starvation.
